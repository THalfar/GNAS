This repo will contain the codes related to my thesis, which, due to scheduling pressures, I completed in six weeks. The [thesis](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:tuni-202208246690) itself is in Finnish, as writing in my native language allowed for the fastest completion. The code is primarily in Finnish and largely uncommented, given the extremely tight schedule. The rush resulted in a confusing original codebase, necessitating a thorough review before any public sharing. It's been over two years since the completion of my thesis work, so it will take time for me to familiarize myself again with what I accomplished then.

Due to these challenges, code will be incrementally added to this repo.
